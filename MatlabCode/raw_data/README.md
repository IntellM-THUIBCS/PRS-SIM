Due to the storage limitation of Github, the example raw SIM data of Microtubules (TIRF-SIM) and Lysosome (3D-SIM) are uploaded on Google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SW7Lt3G5I-D6D-7KFyruIoZX7Cc9Nm_V?usp=sharing .

The raw file is saved in '.mrc' format, which is a common-used format for saving microscopy data. The example IO code for reading '.mrc' file is located in folder 'XxMatlabUtils'.
