<center><h2> Our Team </h2></center><br>
&emsp; Our research team is co-established with the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University and the National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The members are of multi-disciplinary background, including control theory, computation science, optics, biophysics, biological engineering, etc. 
Our scope is to integrate artificial intelligence into current microscope to create a high-performance, multi-functional, bio-friendly microscopy system,
and reveal the unseen biological insight. <br>

&emsp; For any question related to this work or any willingness to cooperate, please contact us as chenxy2021@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn .

*Imaging calcium transients in dendritic spines of a mouse expressing genetically encoded GCaMP6f calcium indicator. One example frame is shown for the raw low-SNR recording (top), DeepCAD-RT denoised recording (middle), and synchronized high-SNR recording with 10-fold SNR (bottom). Magnified views of the yellow boxed region showing calcium dynamics of two spatially adjacent dendritic branches. Scale bar, 20 μm for the whole field-of-view (FOV) and 5 μm for magnified views.*

*Time-lapse imaging of the calcium dynamics of telencephalic neurons in the zebrafish brain (GCaMP6s). Top, the original low-SNR data. Middle, DeepCAD-RT enhanced data. Bottom, high-SNR recording with 10-fold SNR. Magnified views show the neural activity of the yellow boxed region in a short period. Scale bar, 20 μm for the entire FOV and 5 μm for magnified views.*

*Denoising performance of DeepCAD on calcium imaging of Drosophila mushroom body (GCaMP7f). The same frame is shown for the original low-SNR data (left), DeepCAD-RT denoised image (middle), and high-SNR image with 10-fold SNR (right). Magnified views show snapshots of the yellow boxed region at three moments. Scale bar, 10 μm for the whole FOV and 5 μm for magnified views.*

*3D imaging of neutrophil migration in a 150×150×30 μm3 volume (15 planes) after acute brain injury. The raw noisy volume (left) and corresponding denoised volume (right) are visualized in the same perspective. Acute brain injury was induced with craniotomy. Neutrophils were labeled with a fluorescent-conjugated Ly-6G antibody (the green channel). Blood vessels were stained with A wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, the magenta channel) dye. Since blood vessels are stationary, the magenta channel was averaged by multiple frames to improve its SNR. Scale bar, 50 μm.*
