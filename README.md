# PRS-SIM
Source code for our novel self-supervised learning based SIM reconstruction PRS-SIM (pixel-realignment based self-supervised reconstruction for structured illumination microscopy).

The preprint of our manuscript entitled "Self-supervised denoising for structured illumination microscopy enables long-term super-resolution live-cell imaging" is current available at bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.05.535684v1, where the principle, theory, method, and application of PRS-SIM is detailed discussed. 

The illustrative tutorial of our work is available at website https://intellm-thuibcs.github.io/PRS-SIM .
