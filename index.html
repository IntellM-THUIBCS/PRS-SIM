		<center><h1>1. About RES-SIM </h1></center>
		&emsp;<b>RES-SIM</b>  is a self-supervised deep-learning denoising method for structured illumination microscopy, which utilized only the low signal-to-noise
		ratio (SNR) data to train the neural network and inferenced the super-resolution image from the noisy input. The main advantages of RES-SIM are summaried as:<br><br>
		&emsp;1. Only snap-shot low-SNR data is used to constructed the training dataset. <br>
		&emsp;2. The super-resolution information in RES-SIM image is physically guaranteed, instead of the data-driven inference (such as via supervised learning).<br>
		&emsp;3. RES-SIM is compitable with multiple SIM modality, such as TIRF-SIM, 3D-SIM and LLS-SIM (Lattice light-sheet SIM), for 2D imaging and volumetric imaging.<br>
		&emsp;4. RES-SIM is cacaple to work in offline mode to process the time-lapsing data.<br>

		<b>Figure 1</b> | The training and inference scheme of RES-SIM.
		</center>
		<br><br>
		
		&emsp; The main strategy of RES-SIM is to apply image re-corruption to generate an image pair to train the denoiseing network<sup>[2]</sup>, as schemed in Figure 1. 
		To construct the training dataset, a series of noisy low-resolution SIM raw image stack is captured. For each image stack <b>x</b>, 
		we created two corrupted image stack pair <b>y<sub>A</sub></b> and <b><sub>B</sub></b>  
		based on the noise-control matrix <b>D</b> and a randomly variable <b>z</b> as 
		<center><b>y<sub>A</sub></b>=<b>x</b>+D<b>z</b></center> <br>
		<center><b>y<sub>B</sub></b>=<b>x</b>+D<sup>-1</sup><b>z</b></center> <br>
		&emsp; The conventional SIM algorithm is then applied to each stack to generate a corrupted SR image pair <b>Y<sub>A</sub></b> and <b>Y<sub>B</sub></b>, 
		which is arranged as the input and target. To enrich the dataset, the aforementioned step is repeated 3~5 times to each raw image stack, 
		the final training dataset consists of a series corrupted image pairs. <br>
		
		&emsp; The training processing of RES-SIM is to random choose one image in the corrupted image pair as the input image, and the another one as the target. 
		Random cropping, flipping, and rotation operations are applied to each the training set to avoid the overfitting.
		By iteratively optimization the L2-norm loss function, the network parameter will final convengent and acquire the denoising ability. 
		During the inference phase, we first applied conventional SIM algorithm to the noisy raw SIM images to generate a artifact-induced SR SIM image, then
		employed the well-trained model to output the final denoised SR image.<br>
		
		&emsp;In RES-SIM, only a series of independently captured low-SNR raw SIM image stacks are used for training, so it is regarded as "self-supervised denoising".
		The underlying mechanism for RES-SIM is that the re-corrupted image pair statisfying the "independent" creteria (the requirement of N2N training), 
		so the key for a successful image re-corruption is to the properly setting of noise-controlling parameter &alpha;, the Poisson noise factor &beta;<sub>1</sub>, 
		and the Gaussian noise factor &beta;<sub>2</sub>. 
		The theoretical derivation of RES-SIM and the typical setting of the re-corruption parameter is detailed in our manuscript.

		<center><h1>3. Experimental result </h1></center>
		&emsp;We firsty validated RES-SIM on open-source SIM dataset bioSR. The noisy data of signal level from 1 to 10 (low to high) accompanined with the 
		corresponding ground-truth data is inclued in the data. Here for RES-SIM, the raw data of signal level from 1 to 4 was employed for network training.
		We compored the performance of RES-SIM with conventional SIM algorithm, Sparsed-deconvolution SIM, and both the visualization result (Figure 2) and the 
		quantitative ananlysis shown that RES-SIM is capable to remove most artifact and acquire the comparable resoltuion and quality as GT-SIM images.<br>

		&emsp;Due to the similar data-processing framework, RES-SIM is also compitable with 3D-SIM and LLS-SIM system for volumetric SR imaging. 
		We imaged on Lampl-labelled lysosome in COS7 cell via 3D-SIM and TOMM20-labelled mitochondira via LLS-SIM. 
		For each cell, we firstly captured low-SNR raw SIM data with low excitation power and then captured the high-SNR data with the max power as the referred GT data.
		For RES-SIM result, we can conclude that RES-SIM outperformed the conventional SIM result substantially in both axial dimension and later dimensions. (Figure 3)<br>

		&emsp;We then applied RES-SIM on long-term time-lapsing of live cell. In conventional SIM imaging, to avoid the artifact, we have to maintain comparable high excitation power 
		to gurantee the adequate collected photons. However, this will induce high photo-toxicity and cause the malfunction of the live cells, epecially when the time durance is long.
		With RES-SIM, we performed the cell imaging with 10-fold excitation power than used for normal image. 
		As shown in Video 1, the ring-shape CCPs and the filament-shape F-actin can hardly be recongnized in conventional SIM images, 
		while in RES-SIM image, both of them are resolved with a high defination. 
		Benefitting from on the removal of the artifact, semi-automated segmentation algorithm can successfully extract the single filament. 
		We calculated the Mander's overlap coefficient during the cell growth process based on this segmentation,
		and found that CCPs are proned to locate in the gap of actin filament, which is consistent with the visual result (as shown in zoom-in region in Video 1).

		&emsp; Benefitting from the the super-resolution denoised image provided by RES-SIM, both the inner hollow of CCP partical (green) and individual actin filament can be resolved at high defination,
		while the noise-induced artifact overwhelmed the effective sample information in conventional SIM result.
		
		&emsp; We then applied RES-SIM long-term time-lapsing volumetric image via 3D-SIM and LLS-SIM system. For 3D-SIM, we imaged the COS7 cell expressing 
		3xmEmerald-Ensconsin and Lamp1-Halo, with extremely low excitation power. The conventional SIM result is overwhelmed with the artifact and both structures are hardly to resolve.
		While in RES-SIM, since the images are clear, and the interaction between Lysosome bubbles and the Microtubule filaments can be observed, 
		e.g., the lysosome bubble moving along the microtubule filment and the forced deformation microtubule filment of extruded by the lysosome bubble. (Video 2) <br>

		and celluar organelles are of rapid motion. From the RES-SIM enhanced results, the fission and fusion phenomenon can be clearly observed, which is an indicator of the cell activity.

		&emsp; The excitaion power used in all the aforementioned live-cell experiment is at least 10-folder lower that used in conventional imaging so that very low photo-damaged is introduced to the sample.
		Although severe artifact exists in Convention SIM result, RES-SIM substantially removed the artifact and enhanced the contrast, providing a high-defination of different type of organelles. 
		Benefitting from RES-SIM, the partical tracking and structural segmentation algorithm can be applied, enabling the further study of biological insight.
