The detailed tutorial of PRS-SIM is available on our website https://intellm-thuibcs.github.io/PRS-SIM .

Due to the storage limitation of Github, the example SR-SIM after the pixel realignment  Microtubules (TIRF-SIM) and Lysosome (3D-SIM) are uploaded on Google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nYSQ5K94SqkoG65_N3Tn2zPL4dt0T0yX?usp=sharing .
